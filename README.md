# jstiles

This is a jQuery plugin that works alongside with Bootstrap and helps you create beautiful tiles.


## Installation ##

As a jQuery - Bootstrap plugin, in order to use jsTiles you have to include both jQuery and Bootstrap into your project. You also have to include jQuery easing in order to let animations get smoothly executed.

    <head>
	    ....
	    <link href="path/to/../bootstrap-x.x.x/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	    <link href="path/to/../jstiles/css/tl-style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	    <script src="path/to/../jQuery.js"></script>
	    <script src="path/to/../jstiles/jstiles.js"></script>
